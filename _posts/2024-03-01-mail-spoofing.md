**DMARC, DKIM and SPF** are three different authenticacion methods for electronic mail. They all try to prevent from spammers, phishing and spoofing techniques.


## SPF
**Sender Policy Framework (SPF)** is an email authentication method which defines which SMTP servers are authorized to send mail from the email sender's domain.  

SPF uses **DNS** records to ensure that. Recievers can verify SPF information in **TXT** records and therefore reject messages from unauthorized sources **before recieving the body of the message**.
